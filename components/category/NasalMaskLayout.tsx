          <p className="mt-8 text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
            Nasal CPAP masks are among the most popular sleep apnea therapy
            interfaces used by CPAP, APAP, and BiPAP users worldwide. Designed
            to cover only the nose, these masks provide effective airflow
            delivery while maintaining a lightweight and comfortable fit for
            nightly therapy. Many users prefer nasal masks because they offer
            less facial contact compared to full face masks, making them ideal
            for side sleepers, active sleepers, and individuals seeking a more
            natural sleep experience.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-6 text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
            Modern nasal CPAP masks feature advanced cushion technologies,
            flexible headgear systems, quiet exhalation ports, and improved
            seal designs that help reduce air leaks during therapy. These
            innovations improve comfort while supporting consistent airway
            pressure delivery throughout the night. Whether you are newly
            diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea or upgrading your current
            setup, choosing the right nasal mask can significantly improve
            therapy compliance and sleep quality.

            Features to Consider When Choosing a Nasal Mask
          </h2>

          <p className="mt-6 text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
            Selecting the correct nasal CPAP mask involves evaluating cushion
            comfort, seal performance, headgear adjustability, and compatibility
            with your therapy device. A properly fitted mask can help reduce air
            leaks, improve comfort, and support effective sleep apnea treatment.
            Many modern nasal masks include soft silicone cushions, magnetic
            clips, quick-release tubing connections, and quiet airflow
            technology designed to improve the overall therapy experience.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-6 text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
            Proper sizing is equally important. Using the correct cushion size
            helps maintain an effective seal while minimizing pressure points on
            the bridge of the nose. Most manufacturers provide sizing guides and
            multiple cushion options to accommodate different facial structures.
          </p>

          <h2 className="mt-16 text-3xl font-black text-slate-900">
            Cleaning and Maintenance
          </h2>

          <p className="mt-6 text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
            Regular cleaning helps maintain mask performance and hygiene. Wash
            cushions and mask components according to manufacturer guidelines and
            inspect them regularly for signs of wear. Replacing cushions,
            headgear, and other consumable parts at recommended intervals can
            help preserve comfort, seal quality, and therapy effectiveness.
